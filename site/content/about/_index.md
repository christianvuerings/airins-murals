Hello, my name is Irene O’Callaghan, but my family calls me Airin. So you can call me Airin. Together with my boyfriend, a golden retriever and the rest of our dreams we live in Berkeley, California. Originally I am from Barcelona and The Netherlands, and three years ago I moved to the Bay area to pursue my carreer in illustration. I love designing my murals and make a tailor made piece in your home for you and your family. I specialize in children’s rooms and nurseries, but I am open to other fields aswell.
